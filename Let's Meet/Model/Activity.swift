 THIS IS OUR DATA MODEL
 
 As per the official Apple Developer Guide "Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)":
 
 "A data model represents the structure of the information stored in an app."
 
 In this data model, we're storing the information that the group scene (i.e. the app page with the table view of all the groups of people) needs to display. To do so, we'll define this simple class with a name, a photo, and a decription.
