Welcome to the newest app on the block, Let's Meet! It's a tool that enables users to instantly find people with whom they can study, eat lunch, and do other activities -- all without worrying about bothering people who don’t happen to be available to study or hang out at the same time as you.

Let’s jump right in.

Ways to navigate contents:

## Starting/Running the Application
Because it hasn't been published to the App Store, this app can only be run on your own iOS device if you have a iOS Developer Certificate. However, everyone can run it directly in the Xcode simulator, which allows it to function exactly as if it had been downloaded from the App Store. Open the “Let’s Meet.xcworkspace” file and choose the simulator or device to run the app on.   Tap (or click if using the simulator) on the app to open it and you will see the login page.  If you already have an account, enter the email and password you used to sign in.  If you are new, simply tap the register button near the bottom of the screen.

## Register
On this page, there are various blank fields for you to fill: name, email, password (minimum of six characters), and confirm password, as well as a place to upload a profile photo from your device. You won’t be able to proceed unless each field is filled. A profile photo is not necessary to continue. One you’re ready to proceed, selecting “Done” will lead you to the “Your Groups” page.

## Your Groups (2)
The “Your Groups” page shows you a list of the groups you are in.  These could be roommates you might get lunch with, friends you want to hang out with or, most importantly, people you can do a last-minute pset with.  As a member of the group, you can add more members, but only the owner of the group (the one who first made the group) can remove members.  A typical scenario for using this app would be in a large class, especially in the beginning of the semester, when students still don’t know each other. The professor or the Head TF can add everyone in the class into a group allowing you as a member of the class to be able to connect with your classmates and meet for specific activities such as working on psets.
On the top of this page, there is also a profile button (to view your own profile) and a “+” button to create new groups.  If you tap one of the groups in the list of groups, this will lead you to a page with the info for that specific group, including members in the group and activities in the group.

## Your Profile
There are no fields for user input here, just a display of your profile picture, your name, and your email.

## Create a New Group
There is a field for the name of your new group, an optional description field, and an option to add an image from your device’s camera roll.
Once the group is created, a pop-up menu inquires about whether or not you’d like to add a member. Selecting it will bring you to the “Add a New Member” page, while

## Add a New Member
There is a field to enter the email of the individual whom you wish to add to the group.

## Group Information
When you tap a group in the “Your Groups” page, this opens up a page with the Group Information. Here, you can see the activities that are in the group.  For example, if this is a study group, the activities could include specific psets or reviewing specific concepts.  As a member of the group, you can either join an existing activity or create a new one.  From this Group Information page, you can also tap on Members to view members in the group.

## Members
On this page, you are able to see the names and usernames of members of a particular group. You’re given options to add or remove members, as well as leave/delete the group.

## Remove a Member
Only the creator of the group can remove members.

## Add a New Member
See documentation above (Create a New Group > Add a New Member).

## Leave/Delete Group
Only the owner can delete a group, while any member can leave the group if he or she so wishes to.

## Go to an Activity
This page appears after you’ve selected an activity in which you’d like to participate. It gives more specific details of the activity: place, description, as well as starting and ending times. Below this is the button “Can Go!,” which activates the main feature of the app, and leads you to others ready for the same activity!

## You Signed Up Successfully!
You can now see all of the other users who are ready for the activity. This page gives options to add the activity to your calendar, and send a message to others participating.

## Add to Calendar
This button on the top of the “Go to an Activity” page lets you add the activity to the calendar on your phone.  Since each activity has a start and end time associated it, it adds the name, description and location of the activity in the exact slot of time the activity takes place during
## Send a Message
This opens the phone’s email app to send an email to all of the members within the activity.

## Start a New Activity
This is the page to create a new activity for the group.  You can either choose a previous activity from a scroll menu, or you can type in the name of a new activity.  You also can add a description of the activity and a place if you want.  Finally, there is a button that opens a page to allow you to specify the time and date during which the activity will happen.

## Add Start/End Times
Here, you pick the start time and end time. Press “Start” and the activity is made and added to the group!  (You automatically are in this activity).
